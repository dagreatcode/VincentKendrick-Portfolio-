            PROFILE A Little About Me. Well i have been a creator forever. Music,
            anima, and now i want to make a living making websites. I have always
            looked at coding. I always wanted to know how it works. I started of
            learning python and it was really hard. That is what made me love it
            so much. The fact that i can do a little. I really want to find out
            where I end up and how far I go.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            I have a son with autism. Its alot but I know god would never but too
            much on me i can not handle. Like This project. I have been on a long
            road to finding myself. I had to let alot of people go because they
            did not want anything, but i wanted everything. I have never gave up
            on anything no matter how bad it get, i still seem to want to do more.
            Its so easy to give up, and i never want anything easy. This project
            was hard but i still put my all into it... i stay up long nights
            trying to do it on my own. I have made alot of mistake. But i am still
            pushing forwards.
